    "Now that you have your data pipeline working locally, most likely in a notebook or set of Python scripts, it is a good time to think about how you access cloud resources. How do you configure the best development environment you can imagine for using your data pipelines when workflows require big data, occasionally bursting to the cloud, and versioning the results of many experiments? \n",

    "This episode will introduce you to the fundamentals of working with cloud data stores using Metaflow. You can follow along in this [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/outerbounds/tutorials/tree/main/cv-2/cv-S2E3). We will focus on using [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) to upload the files we just downloaded to an S3 bucket, but Metaflow works with [other cloud providers](/docs/engineering-welcome/) as well. This will help us store that data in a place that is accessible to model training environments, whether they are on a laptop or remote GPU-powered instance.   "

    "You can use the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) or [boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html) to communicate with AWS resources from Metaflow code, but using the Metaflow tools has a few advantages.\n",
    "First and foremost, it is fast. The S3 client is optimized for high throughput between S3 and AWS compute instances. This effect becomes powerful when reading and writing to S3 from a remote task running on AWS compute resources. Another principal benefit is the simplicity of the Metaflow client. There are a few intuitive APIs that interoperate seamlessly with your `FlowSpec` definitions. The functionality in `metaflow.S3` includes:\n",
    "- `S3.get` to access a single object with its S3 key.\n",
    "- `S3.get_many` to access many objects *in parallel* with a list of S3 keys.\n",
    "- `S3.put` a single object in a user-specified S3 key.\n",
    "- `S3.put_files` a list of files to add to S3 as files in corresponding S3 keys.\n",
    "You can read details about these functions and more optimized S3 functionality in the [Metaflow API reference](https://docs.metaflow.org/api/S3)."
